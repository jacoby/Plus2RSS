Program to download a JSON-formatted feed from a Google Plus account
and convert it to an RSS Feed.

You will need a Google Plus API key and a Google Plus account. 
Your keys are saved in .plus2rss.yml 

As currently written, the program spits the RSS to STDOUT.
You will want to pipe it to a file, most likely in a crontab.
